            In the realm of finance, predicting stock market trends is both challenging and highly rewarding. This project unveils a
            machine learning model that harnesses the power of LSTM networks to forecast stock prices for any publicly traded company.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Utilizing Historical Data: The model is trained on historical stock price data, encompassing Open, High, Low, and
                    Close prices. Data is sourced using the yfinance library, offering a wide scope of possibilities for selecting
                    different companies by their ticker symbols.

                    Data Visualization and Preparation: Comprehensive data visualization techniques are integrated, providing insights
                    into various stock attributes over different time frames, including daily, weekly, monthly views, and moving averages.
                    The preprocessing stage involves normalization using MinMaxScaler, transforming the Open, High, Low, and Close features
                    into a sequence format suitable for time series prediction.

                <li>
                    Model Architecture and Training: The LSTM network, implemented in PyTorch, is designed to capture sequential
                    patterns within the data. It consists of 64 hidden units and a fully connected layer to output the predicted
                    values for the four key stock features. The model is trained with the Adam optimizer and a Mean Squared Error
                    loss function. To ensure optimal performance, the best model is saved based on validation loss, utilizing training,
                    validation, and test datasets.

                    Prediction and Results: Beyond merely predicting stock prices on the test set, the model is capable of forecasting
                    the next 10 days' stock prices, an invaluable feature for trend analysis. A clear visual comparison between actual
                    vs. predicted stock prices is presented, allowing for an intuitive understanding of the model's accuracy.

                    parameters like the stock ticker, LSTM architecture, sequence length, and number of epochs. This adaptability
                    ensures that the model can be fine-tuned to cater to specific stocks or trading strategies.
