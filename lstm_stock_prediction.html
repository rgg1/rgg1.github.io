    <h1>LSTM Stock Price Prediction</h1>
    <p>
        In the realm of finance, predicting stock market trends is both challenging and highly rewarding. This project unveils a
        machine learning model that harnesses the power of LSTM networks to forecast stock prices for any publicly traded company.
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Utilizing Historical Data: The model is trained on historical stock price data, encompassing Open, High, Low, and
                Close prices. Data is sourced using the yfinance library, offering a wide scope of possibilities for selecting
                different companies by their ticker symbols.

            <li>
                Data Visualization and Preparation: Comprehensive data visualization techniques are integrated, providing insights
                into various stock attributes over different time frames, including daily, weekly, monthly views, and moving averages.
                The preprocessing stage involves normalization using MinMaxScaler, transforming the Open, High, Low, and Close features
                into a sequence format suitable for time series prediction.

            <li>
                Model Architecture and Training: The LSTM network, implemented in PyTorch, is designed to capture sequential
                patterns within the data. It consists of 64 hidden units and a fully connected layer to output the predicted
                values for the four key stock features. The model is trained with the Adam optimizer and a Mean Squared Error
                loss function. To ensure optimal performance, the best model is saved based on validation loss, utilizing training,
                validation, and test datasets.

            <li>
                Prediction and Results: Beyond merely predicting stock prices on the test set, the model is capable of forecasting
                the next 10 days' stock prices, an invaluable feature for trend analysis. A clear visual comparison between actual
                vs. predicted stock prices is presented, allowing for an intuitive understanding of the model's accuracy.

            <li>
                Customization and Adaptability: The model offers high customizability, permitting changes to various
                parameters like the stock ticker, LSTM architecture, sequence length, and number of epochs. This adaptability
                ensures that the model can be fine-tuned to cater to specific stocks or trading strategies.

            <li>
                Educational and Research Focus: While the model showcases a blend of machine learning sophistication and financial
                expertise, it is crafted for educational and research purposes. It serves as a robust framework for understanding
                stock market dynamics and provides a foundation for further exploration and innovation in the field of finance and
                machine learning.

            <li>
                Technical Dependencies: The project relies on libraries such as PyTorch, yfinance, torch-summary, matplotlib, and
                scikit-learn, ensuring a seamless experience whether run locally or on platforms like Google Colab.
