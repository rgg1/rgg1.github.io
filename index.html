        <a href="lstm_stock_prediction.html">LSTM Stock Price Prediction</a>
        <p>
            This project demonstrates a robust framework to forecast stock market trends for any company (example: Amazon).
            By utilizing historical stock price data such as Open, High, Low, and Close prices, an LSTM network implemented
            in PyTorch predicts future stock prices. Comprehensive data visualization techniques, normalization, sequence
            transformation for time series prediction, and a clear comparison of actual vs. predicted prices are included.
            The model is customizable, allowing changes to the stock ticker, LSTM architecture, sequence length, or number
            of epochs. It even provides forecasts for the next 10 days' stock prices. A perfect blend of machine learning
            and finance, this project serves as a valuable tool for understanding stock market dynamics, intended for
            educational and research purposes only.

        <p>
            This project provides an in-depth analysis and comparison of various machine learning models to predict heart
            disease. Leveraging a publicly available dataset, the project explores the relationships between variables such
            as age, gender, cholesterol levels, and chest pain types through comprehensive visualizations. Three models are
            employed: Logistic Regression, K-Neighbors, and Random Forest classifiers, each evaluated using the f1 score to
            understand precision and recall capabilities. Among them, the Random Forest Classifier emerged as the most
            effective, achieving an f1 score consistently above 97% on the test dataset. This work not only offers insights
            into heart disease prediction but also serves as a comparative study on the effectiveness of different modeling
            techniques.

        <a href="mnist_classification.html">Image Classification on Fashion MNIST Dataset Using Various Models</a>
        <p>
            This project showcases the development and evaluation of three deep learning models to classify images from the
            FashionMNIST dataset using PyTorch. Three distinct architectures are explored: a Simple Linear Neural Network, a
            Multilayer Feed-Forward Neural Network, and a Convolutional Neural Network employing the TinyVGG architecture.
            Comprehensive functionalities are included, such as training and testing functions, metrics computation, result
            visualization, and model saving/loading capabilities. The project offers insights into various model performances
            and provides visualizations like random sample predictions, confusion matrix plotting, and cross-model comparisons.
            It serves as a valuable example of applying different neural network architectures to a real-world computer vision
            task.

        <a href="cifar_classification.html">Image Classification on CIFAR-10 Dataset Using a CNN</a>
        <p>
            This project demonstrates the construction and implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using
            PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, a collection of 50,000 32x32 color training images and
            10,000 test images across 10 different classes. As opposed to the previous project on the Fashion MNIST dataset, 
            The CIFAR Dataset uses 3 cchannel images as opposed to 1, providing more challenges when it comes to model construction
            and data preparation. The CNN's architecture includes alternating Convolutional and MaxPool2d layers, followed by
            Flatten and Dense layers, tailored for the 10 classes in the dataset. The model was trained for 10 epochs using the
            Adam optimizer, achieving consistent validation and test accuracies of over 75%. The project includes detailed data
            preparation, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction functionalities. It illustrates a practical
            application of CNNs in image classification and offers avenues for further accuracy improvement through hyperparameter
            tuning and data augmentation.

        <a href="heart_pred_lin_relu.html">Heart Disease Prediction Using Linear layers and ReLU functions</a>
        <p>
            This project presents a machine learning model to predict heart disease using PyTorch, applying linear layers
            interwoven with ReLU activation functions. The dataset comprises various health metrics such as age, sex, chest
            pain type, resting blood pressure, and cholesterol level. The model architecture consists of three hidden layers
            (40, 80, and 60 neurons) and an output layer for binary classification. The project encompasses comprehensive steps
            including data loading, preprocessing (one-hot encoding), training/testing split, neural network definition, and
            evaluation. Achieving over 90% accuracy on the training dataset and consistently over 80% on the testing dataset, this
            model demonstrates a successful application of neural networks in healthcare. Future work could explore hyperparameter
            tuning, architectural adjustments, and preprocessing enhancements.
